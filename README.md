The project appears to focus on casting product image data for quality inspection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It involves industrial data related to casting manufacturing, quality inspection, and automation. The notebook includes sections on building, compiling, and training a CNN model for this purpose.

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automate the quality inspection process in casting manufacturing. The model will analyze product images to classify them as defective or non-defective, improving efficiency and accuracy in industrial quality control.

### Key Components:
Dataset

The dataset consists of casting product images labeled as defective or non-defective.

These images are preprocessed and prepared for model training.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):

A CNN architecture is built to extract features from images.

The model is trained to classify products based on their visual characteristics.

### Model Compilation & Training:

The model is compiled using a suitable loss function and optimizer.

Training is performed on the dataset with validation to ensure accuracy.
### Evaluation & Performance Analysis:

The trained model is tested on new images to evaluate its accuracy.

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are analyzed.

### Outcome & Benefits:
Automation of quality inspection, reducing manual errors.

Improved accuracy in identifying defective products.

Enhanced efficiency in manufacturing by speeding up the inspection process.
